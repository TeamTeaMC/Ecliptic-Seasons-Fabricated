_Perhaps this is the second most important update in the history of the **Ecliptic Seasons** mod!_

This is also the first time we release a release-candidate update at the end of a preview version for testing. It includes approximately 3,700 lines of code. Yes, this update was originally planned for the end of the month.  
However, since all versions together introduced about 15,000 lines of new code, more testing is required to ensure stability.  
If no issues are reported, it will eventually be marked as a stable release.

#### New Features

- Added a configuration GUI, no additional prerequisite mods required
  - Frequently used settings are placed at the front
  - Less commonly used settings are grouped on the last page
  - Tabs allow switching between different configuration categories
  - Supports configuration of Mixins
  - Some settings require a game restart (e.g., Mixin changes)
  - Supports ModMenu (26.1-Fabric) and Configured (1.20.1-Forge)
  - Advanced button allows returning to the default config screen
  - Added config button and multilingual support for 1.20.1
  - Some options must be adjusted in-game:
    - Dimensions where seasons are valid
    - Blocks excluded from snow coverage
  - Supports specialized configuration for certain options:
    - Valid dimension selection
    - Daylight duration adjustment
    - Seasonal behaviors for animals / bees / fishing
    - Blocks excluded from snowy
  - Config synchronization is always server-to-client and resets when back to menu; modifying Common configs in multiplayer is not recommended
  - Does not support complex options unsuitable since vanilla layouts:
    - Snowline
    - Custom block seasonal color overrides

    "default": {
      "sound": "eclipticseasons:music.gacha_bells",

    }
  }
}

* Updated calendar display

    * Added sub-seasons:

        * early_spring / mid_spring / late_spring
        * early_summer / mid_summer / late_summer
        * early_autumn / mid_autumn / late_autumn
        * early_winter / mid_winter / late_winter

    * Sub-seasons are visible in calendar, debug UI, and commands
    * Supported via API
    * Dimension-based (not biome-dependent)
    * Supported in `eclipticseasons:crop` datapack:

```json
{
  "climate": "eclipticseasons:temperate",
  "apply_target": {
    "blocks": "#eclipticseasons:crops/spring"
  },
  "sub_seasons": {
    "early_spring": { "grow_chance": 0.83 },

    "late_winter": { "grow_chance": 0.0 }
  }
}
```

* Also applies to all data/resources using SolarTermValueMap:

    * `eclipticseasons:biome_climate_setting`
    * `eclipticseasons:biome_rain`
    * `eclipticseasons:season_definitions`
    * `eclipticseasons:biome_colors`
    * `eclipticseasons:particles/fallen_leaves`

Example:

```json
{
  "biomes": "minecraft:plains",
  "foliage_colors": {
    "sub_seasons": {
      "early_spring": { "color": -12012264, "mix": 0.0 },
      "mid_spring": { "color": -12012264, "mix": 0.16 },
      "late_spring": { "color": -12012264, "mix": 0.32 }
    }
  },
  "grass_colors": {
    "sub_seasons": {
      "early_spring": { "color": -12012264, "mix": 0.0 },
      "mid_spring": { "color": -12012264, "mix": 0.16 },
      "late_spring": { "color": -12012264, "mix": 0.32 }
    }
  }
}
```

* Added months and day-of-month

    * 12 months per year, aligned with real-world structure
    * Each month roughly corresponds to two solar terms or one sub-season
    * Long solar terms still maintain month alignment
    * Months are not aligned with solar terms/seasons and are not datapack-controlled
    * Note distinction between Gregorian year and solar-term year (default starts Feb 3, Start of Spring)

* Block model seasonal color support (single-tint only):

```toml
[Renderer]
    #Custom seasonal colors for single-tint blocks only.
    #Format: "block_id@color1,color2,...,colorN,placeholder_color,base_color"
    #The number of colors (N) must be a factor of 24 (e.g., 4, 12, or 24).
    #- 4 colors: Seasonal (6 terms each)
    #- 12 colors: Monthly (2 terms each)
    #The 'placeholder_color' maps to index 24; 'base_color' is the final reference hex.
    SeasonalColorOverrides = ["minecraft:spruce_leaves@#96C24E|0.024,#96C24E|0.096,#96C24E|0.18,#96C24E|0.21600002,#96C24E|0.14400001,#96C24E|0.120000005,#5BAE23|0.120000005,#5BAE23|0.072000004,#000000|0.0,#5BAE23|0.120000005,#5BAE23|0.060000002,#000000|0.0,#BEC936|0.060000002,#BEC936|0.120000005,#BEC936|0.14400001,#BEC936|0.18,#BEC936|0.21600002,#BEC936|0.14400001,#253D24|0.21600002,#253D24|0.24000001,#253D24|0.3,#253D24|0.18,#253D24|0.096,#253D24|0.060000002,#000000|0.0,#619961"]
